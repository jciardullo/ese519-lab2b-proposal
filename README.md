# Lab2B Proposal

## Outline & Components

For my proposal, I was considering expanding my RP2040 by adding a switch that can be read by the board and output a signal to an LED. I think that this would suit my level of experience with circuits/electronics and it would be cool to see some sort of real world input/output interactivity with the board. This will require me borrowing a breadboard, button switch, resistor, and an LED from the lab. 

My only question would be: is this a suitable idea for the lab? I am not exactly sure what the teaching staff is looking for in terms of a project, so I would appreciate feedback and also perhaps some example ideas to match my level of experience.
